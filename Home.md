# EUTech

Welcome to a living document to share information about technology in Europe. Here you can find (and contribute) details about a great many things, including software development, machine learning, academia, startups, jobs, salaries, freelancing, and visas. You’re highly encouraged to add anything that you think might help other people who are interested in technology and Europe in the relevant sections (or to create new ones). 

Although this is a living document, content directly in here should aim to be as Evergreen as possible, so don’t add links directly to job openings (though linking to a company’s generic /jobs page is fine), or specific events (though a link to a recurring event is also fine). 

## Why does this exist?

There is a very active ZATech slack community of several thousand developers and other people interested in technology in South Africa. We couldn’t find anything equivalent for Europe, so we decided to create one.

Also, in general there is a global trend to share more and more information and discussion in live chat platforms such as Slack, Telegram, and Whatsapp. This is efficient for short term goals as you can often find the information you are looking for immediately, but it also means that people are spending less time and effort building long term resources like Wikipedia and StackOverflow, and this information needs to be discussed again and again as it gets lost in messy chat histories and proprietary platforms.

## Employment

There is a large supply of technology jobs and a huge shortage globally of people to fill them. [Data Science](https://hbr.org/2012/10/data-scientist-the-sexiest-job-of-the-21st-century) is infamously known as the “sexiest job of the 21st century” and Software Developer is regarded as [the Best Job](https://money.usnews.com/careers/best-jobs/software-developer) by some. 

## Salary transparency

There was a large \#TalkPay movement globally several years ago, encouraging people to talk more openly about their salaries and advocating that the traditional secrecy around money only helps employers to exploit employees. However, salaries are still often shrouded in secrecy and mystery. Some places where you can find basic information about salaries include:

[Levels.fyi - salaries of big tech companies, primarily US](https://www.levels.fyi/)

Some non-traditional startups also operate far more transparently than traditional businesses. For example [Buffer](https://buffer.com/transparency) publishes all salaries, revenue, and many other metrics for anyone who wants to see them.

In general, many people are still not comfortable making (or are not permitted to make) their salaries public. However, many people are willing to share insights into compensation structures that they know of in private or semi-private places - it’s often worth asking!

## Entrepreneurship

### Single person, bootstrapped startups

It’s never been easier to start your own one-person bootstrapped startup. Some people who have done this successfully and written a lot about it include:

## Freelancing

### Technical Writing
Writing educational technical material has a low entry bar if you have some writing skills and some technical knowledge. It's a good way to supplement freelance or other income, as it's very flexible and pays fairly well ($100-$1000/article)
